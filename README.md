# teaching_reviews

These are the teaching reviews I have for the courses I have taught in SUTD. I have not included the Course Summary for the courses where I was not the sole instructor, as my co-instructors have their own preferences in whom they allow to see their reviews. 

This is not to say that my co-instructors do not have good reviews - we all have equally good if not better reviews, but the choice of making course reviews public is usually shaped by the undergraduate and post-graduate institution which my co-instructors did their degrees in. 

On my side, I had the opportunity as a PhD student to be taught by faculty members who posted their own course reviews online, and hence I am following the same trend. 

There is a folder (Old) that includes the teaching reviews for MATH 2940 (a course I was a TA as a graduate student). Unfortunately, these are only the reviews I have (the others are either inaccessible, or in paper format).
